Description: transomics2cytoscape generates a file for transomics visualization
    in 3D space by providing input that specifies the IDs of multiple
    KEGG pathways, their corresponding Z-axis heights, and an input that
    represents the edges between the kinases and enzymes that connect
    the pathways with different Z-axis heights.
